1. Core Theme Concept

Pick one strong direction and commit to it:

Theme: Dark Anime “Hunter” RPG (inspired by Solo Leveling-style hunters and dungeon raids)

The user is a Hunter.

Workouts are Raids/Dungeons.

Muscle groups are Skill Trees.

Nutrition/meal plans are Supply Lines or Guild Provisions.

Weekly check-ins are Guild Reports.

Progress metrics are Character Stats.

Achievements & streaks are Titles, Badges, Artifacts.

This gives you a game-like feel, but all mechanics still map to real fitness behavior.

2. Visual Design System (Dark Anime)

Use this as guidance for your front-end styling.

Colors

Background:

#050712 – main background (near-black, slight blue).

#090d1a – secondary background for cards.

Primary accent:

#7C3AED (purple) or #6366F1 (indigo) – main action color.

Secondary accent:

#22C55E (green) – success/“XP gained”.

#FBBF24 (gold) – highlights, rank badges.

Text:

#F9FAFB – main text.

#9CA3AF – secondary text.

Danger:

#EF4444 – for failed streaks, overdue check-ins.

Typography

Headings: geometric/sci-fi style (e.g. something like “Orbitron”-looking in your design), bold.

Body: simple, readable sans-serif (e.g. Inter/Roboto).

Use uppercase for game meta UI: “RAID START”, “LEVEL UP”, “RANK S”.

Components

Cards: Rounded corners (lg/2xl), subtle glowing border on hover (using primary accent).

Buttons: Solid, gradient background (dark purple → indigo), strong hover state (brighter glow, slight scale).

Progress bars: “XP bar” look:

Dark track, bright gradient fill.

Level number and XP fraction (Lv. 12 – 320/500 XP).

Badges: Small pill-shaped tags:

Gold for rank (S, A, B, C).

Green for streaks (“7-Day Streak”).

Iconography

Use simple line icons but with a fantasy touch:

Sword/shield for workouts.

Heart/health for wellness.

Flame for streaks.

Box/crate for meal plans.

3. Gamification Layer (Mechanics)

Keep it simple but real:

Hunter Level & XP

Each completed workout = XP.

Extra XP for:

Hitting weekly workout target.

Completing weekly check-in.

Logging meals consistently.

Level progression curve (e.g., Level n requires 100 × n XP).

Dungeon/Raid System

Each workout = “Raid”.

Dungeon difficulty: Easy / Normal / Hard.

Map difficulty to:

Volume (sets/reps) or intensity (RPE).

Show “Raid Summary” at the end:

XP earned.

“Damage dealt” = total volume lifted.

“Monsters defeated” = number of exercises completed.

Streaks & Titles

Streak: days with at least one completed workout or logged movement.

Award Titles:

“Novice Hunter” (Lv. 1–4).

“Dungeon Walker” (7+ day streak).

“A-Rank Hunter” (Level threshold).

Show one active Title under username.

Skill Trees

Optional UI:

Strength, Endurance, Mobility, Nutrition as “branches”.

Progress meters for each based on behavior:

Strength = heavy workouts logged.

Endurance = cardio sessions flagged.

Nutrition = consistent meal logging.

This is just a visualization of existing metrics.

Meal Plan Marketplace as “Guild Provisions”

Meal plan cards are “Supply Crates”.

Show “Boost: +Nutrition Consistency” conceptually, but keep it cosmetic.

When user clicks an affiliate link, animate like opening a crate before redirect.

UI & THEME REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

Use a dark anime “Hunter RPG” theme inspired by Solo Leveling-style dungeon raids. The app must feel like a game visually, while still functioning as a serious fitness/nutrition tracker.

VISUAL STYLE
- Dark background: near-black with subtle blue tones.
- Accent colors:
  - Primary: purple/indigo for main actions.
  - Secondary: green for success/XP gained, gold for ranks and highlights.
- Typography:
  - Bold, futuristic/sci-fi style headings (hunter/game feel).
  - Clean sans-serif for body text.
  - Use uppercase for meta labels like “RAID START”, “LEVEL UP”, “RANK A”.
- Components:
  - Card-based layout with rounded corners and subtle glowing borders on hover.
  - XP-style progress bars for levels and goals.
  - Pill badges for difficulty, rank, streaks, and tags.

GAME LAYER
- Treat the user as a “Hunter”.
- Workouts are “Raids” or “Dungeons”.
- Weekly check-ins are “Guild Reports”.
- Meal plan marketplace is “Guild Provisions” with cards representing “Supply Crates”.
- Show Hunter Level and XP in the header or dashboard.
- Each completed workout gives XP and shows a “Raid Cleared” summary with XP, volume lifted, and completion stats.
- Implement streaks and Titles (e.g., Novice Hunter, Dungeon Walker, A-Rank Hunter) as cosmetic achievements tied to existing metrics.

SCREEN UX DETAILS
- Dashboard:
  - Show user avatar, Hunter Level, and Title.
  - “Today’s Raid” card with workout name, difficulty, and big “START RAID” button.
  - Weekly stats (XP, workout completion).
  - Recommended meal plans under a “Guild Provisions” section.
  - If a weekly check-in is due, show a “Guild Report Due” card with CTA.
- Raids (Workouts):
  - List this week’s workouts as raid cards with difficulty badges and XP rewards.
  - Workout detail page styled as a dungeon screen, with exercises as “monsters” and a visible completion/XP bar.
- Stats:
  - Hunter overview with level, XP bar, and Title.
  - Body metrics charts.
  - Optional “Skill Tree” style visualization for Strength, Endurance, Mobility, Nutrition using radial or bar meters.
- Nutrition:
  - Daily log with calorie and macro targets shown as progress bars.
  - Access to “Guild Provisions” (meal plan marketplace) from this screen.
- Meal Plan Marketplace:
  - Cards for external subscription meal plans with provider logo, tags, price, and CTA.
  - Use game flavor names and subtle “crate” visuals, but keep the content transparent (clear pricing, description, external link).
  - On click, log the click and redirect to affiliateUrl.
- Check-ins:
  - Week-level “Guild Report” form with rating scales and text areas, plus progress photos.
  - Add a small XP reward and feedback screen after submission.

GENERAL
- All game elements are cosmetic wrappers over standard fitness features (workouts, logs, check-ins, progress, meal plans).
- Prioritize clarity and usability over heavy effects: the user must always know what to do next to complete their workout, log meals, or submit a check-in.
- Ensure the app works cleanly on mobile with a bottom navigation: Home, Raids, Stats, Nutrition, Provisions.
